A carefully curated collection of high-quality resources, tools, research papers, implementations, and tutorials dedicated to Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) â€” the emerging frontier of cryptographic security designed to withstand quantum adversaries. This repository serves as a comprehensive, structured knowledge hub for researchers, engineers, and policymakers working toward building a quantum-resilient digital infrastructure.

PQC represents a paradigm shift in secure communication, focusing on mathematical problems that remain intractable even for large-scale quantum computers. The collection covers all major algorithmic families â€” lattice-based, code-based, hash-based, multivariate, isogeny-based, and MPC-in-the-Head schemes â€” as well as topics spanning implementation security, hardware acceleration, hybrid protocols, and cryptographic migration strategies.

By organizing both foundational and applied materials, this repository bridges the gap between theoretical cryptography and real-world deployment. It includes resources on the NIST PQC standardization process, hardware optimizations for ML-KEM and ML-DSA, integration guides for IoT and embedded devices, and up-to-date results on side-channel resistance, performance benchmarking, and hybrid key exchange.
